# DVC usage
[DVC](dvc.org) is used to separate version control of large datasets from processing codes and configurations stored on GitHub.
For the `zarr_fuse` repository the large datasets are stored on Google drive under the shared drive `zarr_fuse`.

## DVC Setup 

1. Use 'bin/dvc_install.sh' for pip install into a Python environment 
   or [DVC install](https://dvc.org/doc/install) for other options like install it system-wide.
   
2. Download the DVC secret [config script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dag4N3KYz5q9rkLURayXHjUV0yN-zYYH/view?usp=drive_link),
   place it to the root of the repository local copy under original name. NEVER COMMIT THIS FILE.

3. Execute the script like:

        ```
        bash dvc_secret_config.sh
        ```

4. Pull the large files:
        ```
        dvc pull
        ```
   The browser should open to ask you for the login to your Google account (the TUL one ussually).
   
   
See [large datasets modification doc](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/data-management/modifying-large-datasets) for further work.

## Adding remote (initialization)

1. Initialize `.dvc` folder. From the repository root run:

        ```
        dvc init
        ``` 

2. Add google drive remote [DZ04_Chodby/Podklady/endorse_large_files](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/109cr1pZ8GV5s8yXKgVzl8NPQ8j537E4T)

        ```
        dvc remote add -d gdrive gdrive://109cr1pZ8GV5s8yXKgVzl8NPQ8j537E4T

        ```

The hash comes form the link.
