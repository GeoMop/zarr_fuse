# PLAN

## Status Snapshot

- `PLAN.md` is the active planning document for current repository work.
- `_PLAN.md` contains older branch-specific review notes and is treated as
  historical input, not the active plan.
- Current user priority: fix a small set of failing tests, first separating
  true code failures from failures caused by missing secrets or remote access.

## Active Priorities

### P0. Triage failing tests

- Identify the currently failing tests and group them into:
  - deterministic local failures
  - S3 or secret-gated failures
  - hangs or timeout regressions
- Reproduce local failures with targeted pytest invocations before any broader
  suite run.
- For S3-backed tests, prefer explicit skip conditions when required secrets or
  endpoints are unavailable.

### P1. Stabilize local store open behavior

- Continue the investigation from `_PLAN.md` around local store open hangs in
  `zarr_fuse/zarr_storage.py`.
- Prioritize `test_open_store[options0]`, `test_node_tree[local]`, and related
  local-only coverage before touching S3 behavior.
- Add or refine a deterministic regression test once the blocking path is
  confirmed.

### P1. Review empty dataset first-write semantics

- Revisit the `__empty__` handling and first-write path in
  `zarr_fuse/zarr_storage.py`.
- Ensure first update does not destructively reset sibling metadata or child
  groups.
- Add regression coverage for empty-to-first-write transitions.

### P2. Tighten schema and read-path consistency

- Reconcile the `composed` attribute contract across write and read code paths.
- Fix or confirm the coordinate uniqueness validation noted in `_PLAN.md`.
- Add tests only after the intended behavior is explicit.

### P2. Separate S3 compatibility work

- Keep S3 async/sync behavior review separate from local test stabilization.
- Avoid mixing environment setup issues with library regressions in one change.
- When S3 tests are expected to require secrets, document that requirement in
  the test or fixture entry point.

## Working Rules For This Plan

- Prefer small, focused fixes over wide refactors while test failures are still
  being triaged.
- Update this file before larger code changes and after major findings.
- Record unresolved repo questions in the last section of this file.

## AGENT Questions And Remarks

- The worktree contains many untracked files, including local secret-bearing
  and environment-specific files. Treat them as user state and do not normalize
  or clean them without an explicit request.
- Some existing tests already skip when S3 credentials are absent, but the repo
  still mixes local and remote assumptions. That boundary should be made more
  explicit during test-fix work.

## AGENT log

- 2026-06-20: Reviewed `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `python_coding.md`, and
  `_PLAN.md`.
- 2026-06-20: Created a structured `PLAN.md` aligned with the current user
  priority of failing-test triage.
- 2026-06-20: Updated `AGENTS.md` to clarify plan ownership and secret-gated
  test handling.
